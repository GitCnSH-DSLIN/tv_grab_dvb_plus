This is an xmltv grabber for DVB, Freesat, Sky (AU, UK and IT)
and MediaHighway EPG data.


Mark Spieth took the code from loadepg and made it run standalone.
Simon Kenyon took the Freesat code from MythTV and added it to tv_grab_dvb.
At the beginning of April 2009, they decided to collaborate and produce
a single grabber which would handle various different data sources.


It is based on the work of a number of people, for which we are grateful.

Luca De Pieri <dpluca@libero.it> has written a plugin for VDR.
For further details see http://lukkinosat.altervista.org/

Jean-Claude Repetto <mhwepg@repetto.org> has written a related program
to parse the data for input to VDR.
For further details see http://jrepetto.free.fr/

Mark Bryars <dvb@darkskiez.co.uk> has written an xmltv grabber which gets
its data from a standard DVB data stream.
For further detailse see http://www.darkskiez.co.uk/

David Matthews <David Matthews <dm@prolingua.co.uk> wrote the code that went
into MythTV to read the Freesat EPG.
Fir further details see http://www.mythtv.org/

At the moment you need to use [tsc]zap to point to the correct transponder
and then tv_grab_eit will convert the EPG data into xmltv format. This can
then be fed into any number of programs. I use it for MythTV.

We hope you find this useful. The hard work was done by others.

The configuration files are located in ./conf
Is possible specify a directory for configuration files with the option '-c'.
For example:

tv_grab_dvb_plus -c /usr/share/tv_grab_dvb_plus ...

epg.conf       This file contains the list of sources for loading of epg data.
	       The format is as follows:

For loading epg data sent to Mediahighway (Ver.1) receivers:
MHW1:<YourDescription>:<Frequency>:<Polarization>:<Source>:<SymbolRate>
    
For loading epg data sent to Mediahighway (Ver.2) receivers:
MHW2:<YourDescription>:<Frequency>:<Polarization>:<Source>:<SymbolRate>

For loading epg data sent to Sky receivers:
SKY:<YourDescription>:<Frequency>:<Polarization>:<Source>:<SymbolRate>:<DictionaryHuffman>:<Themes>

sky_xx.dict   This file is dictionary Huffman for decoding epg data sent to
              Sky receivers.

sky_xx.themes This file is table themes.

In the above xx can be au, uk or it.
Currently au is the same as uk.
